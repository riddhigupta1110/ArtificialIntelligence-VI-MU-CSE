## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Ensure you have SWI-Prolog installed on your machine. You can download it from [SWI-Prolog's official website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riddhigupta1110/ArtificialIntelligence-VI-MU-CSE.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd ArtificialIntelligence-VI-MU-CSE
```

## Usage
### **I) Python Programs:**
You can run each Python program using any code editor or the command line:

Using Visual Studio Code:
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder (ArtificialIntelligence-VI-MU-CSE) in VS Code.
3. Open the desired .py file.
4. Run the program by pressing F5 or by clicking the "Run" button in the top-right corner of the editor.

### **II) Prolog Program:**

Writing and Executing a Prolog Program:
1. Write your Prolog program using any text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or Notepad) and save it with a **.pl** extension in the folder of your choice.
2. In SWI-Prolog, load your program by clicking on File -> Consult and then opening the desired file.
3. Once the program is loaded, you can start using it by entering queries in the SWI-Prolog console.
